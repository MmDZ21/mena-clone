# MENA Resource â€” Layout Clone

This is a Next.js 15 + Tailwind starter that mimics the layout, structure and UX of menaresource.com without copying their branding or proprietary content.

## Quick start

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000

## Notes

- Contact form uses a Server Action stub. Wire it to SMTP, a DB, or a CRM.
- Pages included: Home, About, Lithium Ore Supply, Contact Us, Consulting (+ 6 subpages).
- Pure Tailwind + minimal components (no UI kit). Framer Motion for hero animations, Lucide for icons.
- Fully static by default; deploy anywhere (Vercel, Node, Docker, etc.).
